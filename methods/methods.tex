\section*{Bayesian models of IFN-I resistance of HIV-1 plasma isolates from longitudinally sampled participants}
To create a simple model of the temporal dynamics of type I interferon (IFN-I) resistance, \ifna{} and \ifnb{} \icFifty{} values were each modeled using a Bayesian change point hierarchical model.
  The model is based on a segmented regression of the log \icFifty{} making the following simplifying assumptions:
    \begin{itemize}
          \item Each participant has a level of resistance at the acute infection stage drawn from separate population-level distributions for typical, non- or fast progressors.
          \item Each participant has a drop (or rise) in IFN-I resistance from acute levels drawn from separate population-level distributions for typical, non- or fast progressors.
          \item Each participant has a time to nadir drawn from separate population-level distributions for typical, non- or fast progressors.
          \item Resistance changes linearly from onset of symptoms to time of nadir.
          \item The nadir of IFN-I resistance represents a changepoint in the data. Following this point, changes in IFN-I resistance are modeled as a linear function of CD4+ T cell count changes away from the count found at nadir.
          \item Where data is not present, CD4+ T cell counts are assumed to be linearly interpolated between adjacent observations.
    \end{itemize}
  
 The log \icFifty{} observation from each viral isolate $i$ was modeled as a normal distribution $\text{IC50}_i\sim\text{Normal}(\mu_i,\sigma)$ with mean $\mu_i$ where:
\begin{align*}
  \mu_i=\begin{cases} 
    \alpha_{\text{person}_i}+\delta_{\text{person}_i}\frac{\text{time}_i}{s_{\text{person}_i}} & \text{if } \text{time}_i<s_{\text{person}_i}\\
    \alpha_{\text{person}_i}+\delta_{\text{person}_i} + \beta_{\text{person}_i}(\text{CD4}_{\text{person$_i$},\text{time}_i}-\text{CD4}_{\text{person$_i$},s_\text{person$_i$}}) & \text{if } \text{time}_i\ge s_{\text{person}_i}\\
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}
where the parameters $\alpha_j$ represent the level of IFN-I resistance at symptom onset, $\delta_j$ represents the change from symptom onset to nadir and $s_j$ represents the time of nadir in person $j$. Study participant data is represented by $\text{time}_i$ corresponding to the time since onset of symptoms and $\text{person}_i$ recording the participant from which isolate $i$ was collected, $\text{CD4}_{j,k}$ containing the estimated CD4+ T cell count for person $j$ at time $k$ and $\text{progression}_j$ is the disease progression type (fast/non/typical) for participant $j$. The hierarchical probabilities for these parameters were:
\begin{align*}
  \sigma & \sim \text{Gamma}(1,0.1)\\
  \alpha_j& \sim \begin{cases}
    \text{Normal}(\theta_{\alpha,\text{typical}},\tau_{\alpha})  &\text{ if } \text{progression}_j=\text{typical}\\
    \text{Normal}(\theta_{\alpha,\text{typical}}+\theta_{\alpha,\text{fast}},\tau_{\alpha}) &\text{ if } \text{progression}_j=\text{fast}\\
    \text{Normal}(\theta_{\alpha,\text{typical}}+\theta_{\alpha,\text{non}},\tau_{\alpha}) &\text{ if } \text{progression}_j=\text{non}\\
  \end{cases}\\
  \delta_j& \sim \begin{cases}
    \text{Normal}(\theta_{\delta,\text{typical}},\tau_{\delta})  &\text{ if } \text{progression}_j=\text{typical}\\
    \text{Normal}(\theta_{\delta,\text{typical}}+\theta_{\delta,\text{fast}},\tau_{\delta}) &\text{ if } \text{progression}_j=\text{fast}\\
    \text{Normal}(\theta_{\delta,\text{typical}}+\theta_{\delta,\text{non}},\tau_{\delta}) &\text{ if } \text{progression}_j=\text{non}\\
  \end{cases}\\
  %s_j & \sim \text{NegativeBinomial}(\theta_s,\tau_s)\\
  s_j& \sim \begin{cases}
    \text{NegativeBinomial}(\theta_{s,\text{typical}},\tau_s)  &\text{ if } \text{progression}_j=\text{typical}\\
    \text{NegativeBinomial}(\theta_{s,\text{typical}}\exp(\theta_{s,\text{fast}}),\tau_s)  &\text{ if } \text{progression}_j=\text{fast}\\
    \text{NegativeBinomial}(\theta_{s,\text{typical}}\exp(\theta_{s,\text{non}}),\tau_s) &\text{ if } \text{progression}_j=\text{non}\\
  \end{cases}\\
  \beta_j& \sim \begin{cases}
    \text{Normal}(\theta_{\beta,\text{typical}},\tau_{\beta})  &\text{ if } \text{progression}_j=\text{typical}\\
    \text{Normal}(\theta_{\beta,\text{fast}},\tau_{\beta})  &\text{ if } \text{progression}_j=\text{fast}\\
    \text{Normal}(\theta_{\beta,\text{non}},\tau_{\beta})  &\text{ if } \text{progression}_j=\text{non}\\
  \end{cases}\\
\end{align*}
where $j$ indicates each participant and $\text{NegativeBinomial(x,y)}$ represents a negative binomial distribution parameterized such that the expected value is $x$ and the variance is $x+\frac{x^2}{y}$. All hyperparameters were given prior probabilities of $\theta_x \sim \text{Normal(0,10)}$ for parameters representing the means of a distribution and $\tau_x \sim \text{Gamma}(1,0.1)$ for parameters representing standard deviations other than $\theta_{\alpha,\text{typical}}$ and $\theta_{s,\text{typical}}$ which were given a flat prior and $\tau_s \sim \text{Cauchy}(0,10)$.

For computational efficiency, the nadir time parameter $s$ was discretized to weekly intervals, assumed to fall within 1 to 150 weeks after symptom onset and marginalized out of the joint probability:
\[p(\text{IC50},\text{...})=p(\text{...})\prod_{i=1}^n\sum_{s=1}^{150}\text{Normal}(\text{IC50}_i|\mu_{i,s},\sigma)\text{NegativeBinomial}(s|\theta_s,\tau_s)\]
where $\text{...}$ represents all parameters other than $s$ and $\mu_{i,s}$ is defined the same as $\mu_i$:
\[\mu_{i,s}=\begin{cases}
    \alpha_{\text{person}_i}+\frac{\text{time}_i}{s}\delta_{\text{person}_i} & \text{if } \text{time}_i<s\\
    \alpha_{\text{person}_i}+\delta_{\text{person}_i} + \beta_{\text{person}_i}(\text{CD4}_{\text{person$_i$},\text{time}_i}-\text{CD4}_{\text{person$_i$},s}) & \text{if } \text{time}_i\ge s\\
  \end{cases}
\]

Posterior probabilities were estimated with 50 Markov chain Monte Carlo chains of 5000 iterations each using Stan (\stanRef{}).


\section*{Bayesian models of IFN-I resistance of outgrowth and rebound HIV-1 isolates}
  To compare the IFN-I resistance of viral isolates derived from plasma samples collected during acute, chronic and rebound infections, as well as from viably frozen PBMCs collected during ART suppression (QVOA), \ifna{} and \ifnb{} \icFifty{} values were modeled using a Bayesian hierarchical model. The model is based on the assumptions that:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Isolates found at acute infection form a base level of IFN-I resistance for a given person.  Resistances in virus isolated from chronic, ART suppressed and rebound infection for this person are modelled as changes from this initial level.
    \item The mean \icFifty{} level within each person for acute isolates and the change from acute levels for chronic, QVOA and rebound isolates are drawn from a population-level distribution for that type. 
    \item QVOA isolates are separated into to two populations; a ``pre'' group composed of QVOA viruses isolated from study participants prior to or in the absence of treatment interruption (ATI) and a ``post'' group of QVOA viruses isolated from participants following ATI and reinitiation of ART.
    \item In both QVOA populations, the viruses can include some proportion of rebound-like isolates. This mixture is modeled in both pre- and post-treatment so that differences in mixture proportion between the two populations can be assessed.
    \item Variation in the potency of INF-I used to experimentally determine \icFifty{} values may shift the inferred resistance for isolates tested in other studies. This effect is modeled as a multiplicative shift in \icFifty{} for all isolates measured outside this study (acute recipient and chronic donor isolates from ref.\ \iyerRef{}).
    \item Isolates from participants who received exogenous \ifna{} during treatment interruption may display altered interferon resistance. This effect is modeled as a multiplicative shift in \icFifty{} for all rebound isolates from such participants (participants 004, 030, and 044 from ref.\ \azzRef{}).
  \end{itemize}

  The log \icFifty{} observation from each viral isolate $i$ from acute, chronic and rebound isolates was modeled as a normal distribution:
  \[\text{IC50}_i\sim\text{Normal}(\mu_{\text{type}_i,\text{person}_i},\sigma_\text{type$_j$})\]
  with the mean resistance for isolate type $j$ from person $k$:
  \begin{align*}
    \mu_{j,k}\sim&\begin{cases}
      \text{Normal}(\alpha_{k}+\beta_{\text{batch}}\text{batch}_k,\psi_j) & \text{if } j=\text{acute}\\
      \text{Normal}(\alpha_{k}+\beta_{j,k}+\beta_{\text{batch}}\text{batch}_k+\beta_{\text{\textsc{ifn}}}\text{IFN}_{k},\psi_j) & \text{if } j=\text{rebound}\\
      \text{Normal}(\alpha_{k}+\beta_{j,k}+\beta_{\text{batch}}\text{batch}_k,\psi_j) & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
  \end{align*}
  where $\text{type}_i$ indicates whether isolate $i$ was isolated during acute, chronic, QVOA or rebound infection from participant $\text{person}_i$, $\text{batch}_k$ indicates when isolates from person $k$ were tested in another study and $\text{IFN}_k$ indicates when person $k$ was treated with exogenous \ifna{} prior to and during treatment interruption. Parameters are included for the mean resistance level during acute infection for each person $\alpha_k$, standard deviation of isolates of type $j$ within a person $\sigma_j$, standard deviation of mean resistance for type $j$ isolates among people $\psi_j$, change from acute levels in isolates of type $j$ in a given participant $\beta_{j,k}$, the effects of exogenous IFN treatment $\beta_{\textsc{ifn}}$ and batch to batch variation in IFN in isolates assayed in previous studies $\beta_{\text{batch}}$. 


  For QVOA isolates, the \icFifty{} was modeled as a mixture of two populations such that:
  \[
  \begin{split}
    p(\text{IC50}_i|\mu_{\text{\textsc{qvoa}},\text{person}_i},&\sigma_{\text{\textsc{qvoa}}},\mu_{\text{rebound},\text{person}_i},\sigma_{\text{rebound}},\phi_{\text{prePost}_i})=\\
    &\phi_{\text{prePost}_i}\text{Normal}(\text{IC50}_i|\mu_{\text{rebound},\text{person}_i},\sigma_{\text{rebound}})\\
    &+ (1-\phi_{\text{prePost}_i})\text{Normal}(\text{IC50}_i|\mu_{\text{\textsc{qvoa}},\text{person}_i},\sigma_{\text{\textsc{qvoa}}}) 
  \end{split}
  \]
  where $\text{prePost}_i$ indicates whether isolate $i$ was isolated  pre- or post-ATI and and $\phi_\text{pre}$ and $\phi_\text{post}$ represent the proportion of rebound-like virus present in pre- and post-ATI QVOA isolates.


The hierarchical parameter priors were modeled as:
  \begin{align*}
    \sigma_j & \sim \text{Gamma}(1,0.1)\\
    \psi_j & \sim \text{Gamma}(1,0.1)\\
    \phi_{\text{pre}} & \sim \text{Uniform}(0,1)\\
    \phi_{\text{post}} & \sim \text{Uniform}(0,1)\\
  \end{align*}
where $j$ indicates the isolate type (acute, chronic, QVOA, rebound). All $\alpha_k$, $\beta_{j,k}$ were given flat priors and $\beta_{\text{\textsc{ifn}}}\sim\text{Normal}(0,10)$ and $\beta_{\text{batch}}\sim\text{Normal}(0,10)$.

Posterior probabilities were estimated with 50 Markov chain Monte Carlo chains of 5,000 iterations each using Stan (\stanRef{}).
